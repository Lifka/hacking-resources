 * [Pyrit](https://github.com/JPaulMora/Pyrit): It  allows you to create massive databases of pre-computed WPA/WPA2-PSK authentication phase in a space-time-tradeoff. By using the computational power of Multi-Core CPUs and other platforms through ATI-Stream,Nvidia CUDA and OpenCL, it is currently by far the most powerful attack against one of the world's most used security-protocols.
 * [wepattack](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wepattack/): Active dictionary attack on WEP keys in WLAN networks.

#### WPA3

##### Dragonblood
 * [dragondrain-and-time](https://github.com/vanhoefm/dragondrain-and-time): dragondrain tool can be used to test wether, or to which extend, an Access Point is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks against WPA3's SAE handshake. dragontime is an experimental tool to perform timing attacks against the SAE handshake if MODP group 22, 23, or 24 are supported. Note that most WPA3 implementations by default do not enable these groups.
 * [dragonforce](https://github.com/vanhoefm/dragonforce): It is an experimental tool which takes the information recovered from our timing or cache-based attacks, and performs a password partitioning attack. This is similar to a dictionary attack.
 * [dragonslayer](https://github.com/vanhoefm/dragonslayer): This is an experimental tool to test WPA3's SAE and EAP-pwd implementations for vulnerabilities. We also strongly recommend to perform code inspections to assure all vulnerabilities have been properly addressed.

#### Image
 * [CryptaPix](https://www.briggsoft.com)
 * [gifshuffle](http://www.darkside.com.au)
 * [OpenStego](https://github.com/syvaidya/openstego): It is a steganography application that provides two functionalities: a) Data Hiding: It can hide any data within an image file. b) Watermarking: Watermarking image files with an invisible signature. It can be used to detect unauthorized file copying.
